# How-Hard-is-bribery-with-Randomly-Selected-Voters

we present a systematic study on the resistance of an election with a randomly selected voter committee against bribery. Since the committee is randomly generated, by bribing any fixed subset of voters, the designated candidate may or may not win. Consequently, we consider the problem of finding a feasible solution that maximizes the winning probability of the designated candidate. We show that for most voting rules, this problem becomes extremely difficult for the briber as even finding any non-trivial solution with non-zero objective value becomes NP-hard. However, for plurality  and 1-veto, there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme which computes a near-optimal solution efficiently. The algorithm builds upon a novel integer programming formulation together with techniques from $n$-fold integer programming, which may be of a separate interest.
